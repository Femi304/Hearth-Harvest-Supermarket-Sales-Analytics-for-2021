The outlet stores showed the lowest sales. Investigate why sales are lower (e.g., location, product availability, customer preferences) and consider local marketing or exclusive outlet promotions.

Promote bread more effectively to boost its sales, perhaps by bundling it with high-selling items like juice.
Highlight best-selling products, like juice, in advertisements to attract more customers.

The average feedback score is moderate at 3.01. Conduct surveys to understand customer concerns and improve service or product offerings.

With male customers making up 52% of total sales, consider targeted promotions for female customers to balance gender-based sales or tap into potential growth.
